# My dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo. I recently switched to Linux, so this is still a work in progress.

Currently, I'm using Manjaro with GNOME, but I'm considering switching to a different distro. I'm also
planning on using a window manager instead of a desktop environment. I'm still researching my options.

Feel free to create an issue when you have comments, tip, questions...
